I liked that app once I started using it, however, it has a major flaw. It randomly disconnects mid-ride, and that causes your electric motor to shut down. I've reached out with multiple emails to Trek, but no support so far. 
It also doesn't return to the information for the ride up to that point, which means that you will see something like 15 minutes of a two hour ride. Extremely frustrating.",1,2.9,flspy,negative

However, integration with the Apple ecosystem is very poor. Can’t use the Apple Watch to track heart rate. Can’t export any activities to Apple health. This means you have to use multiple apps for any health tracking, which is doubly unfortunate because the Trek Central app has all of the motor vs human data, so can provide a much more accurate picture than e.g. Strava or Wahoo.

It was horrible before this update, now the bike doesn’t even connect to the app. It used to take anywhere from 2-5 minutes HOLDING COMPLETELY STILL for it to connect to the app. Even then, it would disconnect MID RIDE 25% of the time, it’s horrible. What’s worse, when the bike is attempting to connect, and you’re riding it, it stutter stops and sometimes turns off, which is incredibly dangerous. I’m writing this while waiting in a line, not 20 feet from my bike and it couldn’t find it anymore, so I don’t even know if it will work anymore. To the developers, maybe ride the bike to see how awful your app is, before patting yourself on the back. It’s been almost a year before this update rolled out, nothing between then and now, and nothing that was bad was fixed. You added nonsense to the app, only over complicating things.

Bike type not found”. I have deleted and reinstalled the app, deleted the bike from Bluetooth, and reset the bike numerous times  without success. Very disappointing!
Update:  Trek reports that a fix is in the works.",1,1.8,Trygg48,negative

80,2022-11-06T07:11:13-07:00,"Trek needs to fix this asap. Embarrassing how buggy the app is and how poorly designed the account signup process is; both from a security perspective and UI/UX. Good design means don’t force bad passwords. Do make it easy to use password managers and allow pasting. Also, don’t allow the app to crash every time you change a simple setting (high/mid/eco). Wouldn’t have believed it was so terrible if hadn’t seen it myself.",1,1.5,nathan-appstore,negative
81,2022-09-05T09:21:41-07:00,Will be useful once reliable information is provided. The motor tuning portion works flawlessly so far. The elevation and mapping is off and buggy. Overall nicely put together it just needs some fine tuning and the maps need more options so I don’t need to use trail forks or mtb project at the same time. It shows a lot of promise if TQ continues to refine it.,4,1.0,Trek/exe/9.7,positive
