0,2025-06-30T22:03:26-07:00,The one feature I need is the actual battery percentage.   I’d like to know if I have 18% or 2% left.   Bars are inadequate.   I’m highly disappointed as this is a safety issue,1,2.0.10,kdspeight,negative
1,2025-06-04T20:00:22-07:00,I’ve used the app on and off for the last six months and usually within the first five minutes of the ride exits out and multiple meters stop wording working whether it’s cadence or speed or distance traveled. I’ve unloaded it loaded it doesn’t change. This thing is horrible.,1,2.0.10,Fended ski,negative
2,2025-03-31T19:03:37-07:00,"I use it as my primary—while I ride—bike computer, and it’s works really well for that on a Shimano 11 speed rim brake Di2. I come from using Shimano’s Flight Deck bike computer (when mechanical) and this is the natural progression from that.  Highly customizable, rudimentary d-fly switch control, perfect for on the fly computing.  Not quite stable enough to solely be relied upon to track your rides if you don’t want to lose a ride every now and then, but hey, it’s on my phone, so I run Cyclemeter in the background for that.  I love that it—like Flight Deck—displays what chain ring and cassette gear I’m in (if you tell it to).  I also love that it displays my sensor battery status (Wahoo speed and cadence, Watch HR, and my Di2 battery status).  Other than providing a nice picture at the end for the record of the ride, its map function is completely useless.  But hey, it’s on my phone, I’ve got Google Maps for that.  I bought an iPhone 13 mini to use with it because that’s the smallest and lightest iPhone with a decent battery life.  Quadloc mount. With a new battery in the 13 mini it can easily go 6 hours without worrying about battery life—and that’s streaming Bluetooth to my AirPod pro’s, running gps on at least two apps constantly, with the screen always on, and with an Apple Watch connected, a BT speed sensor, BT cadence sensor, and a dongle converting and broadcasting the Apple Watch HR data to BT HRP.  If I had a power sensor it would display date from that as well (I don’t, but I’m looking at them on eBay which is a bad sign that I will sooner or later).  I understand that it also works with e-bikes, but I can’t speak to that. It has its strengths and weaknesses, but its strengths are so strong that they far outweigh its shortcomings.  It’s silly to use a dedicated head (that costs $$$) and is heavy, when you have your phone with you anyway and This is a really good app for that.",5,2.0.10,Curtis Gray 34,positive
3,2024-11-21T00:58:48-07:00,"It has happened three times already during long rides, the app will crash when you switch off the display or switch to a different app. When you look at the etube ride app again it restarts and gives a message that the ride was corrupted and therefore deleted...completely unacceptable it should not crash and if it does it should restart the cached ride. Also, it needs to integrate to other services especially now that strava is shutting down their API access you need the ability to send to training peaks and other apps as well.",1,2.0.8,Scipio05,negative
4,2024-11-16T15:23:10-07:00,"Generally it’s pretty good/I don’t have a ton of complaints. It would be nice if it auto connected to the bike, but the 3 seconds it takes me to hit the Bluetooth button isn’t a big deal/I’ve gotten used to it. The one thing I really wish it had is cumulative stats, both by month and by year. I do a lot of mutisport racing and this is the only app i use that is 100% dedicated to cycling. While I can do it manually, it would be super useful for gaging mileage, particularly for determining things like how many miles are on the tires.",4,2.0.8,fishgirl1,positive
5,2024-10-05T18:57:11-07:00,"Supposedly and according to Shimano Service Trch, this spp works with the SC-EN610 Shimano cycling computer but the searching wheel goes round and round but never  connects using my iPhone 14.",1,2.0.8,1Timothy3:16,negative

7,2024-06-18T16:59:48-07:00,"Last three rides that I’ve tracked have either stopped logging entirely, logged some stats but incorrect distance and time (I burned 1100 kCals in 1.96 miles at a 192W average 🤣).

Like how it has trail map integrated. 
Just not sure about the only one small offline map download ever 30 days??
I ride different areas and need more than that??
Can you pay to download more??",5,2.0.8,mclydegaz,positive
10,2024-04-08T08:35:07-07:00,"I use this app to get the most accurate reading for exercise data while riding my MTB, and I overall enjoy the app, but I really wish that it integrated with the Health app.",4,2.0.8,DirtyJ375,positive
11,2024-04-04T17:06:15-07:00,"The app is simple and works great on the iphone.  Only complaint is that there is no apple watch support.  Please Shimano, read this review and update the app to include a simple apple watch screen. Even if all it does is show  battery life.",3,2.0.8,andersdmd,neutral

14,2024-01-13T07:22:31-07:00,"This app would absolutely be perfect if you could only import a GPX route. Otherwise, it is pretty much would be the perfect bike computer app with all of its sensor integrations, and DI2 integration for controlling the screen.

Unfortunately, the lack of being able to import a route pretty much indicates an eval, those other perfect items have. If you can’t get anywhere, what’s the point?",1,2.0.8,exabrial,negative
15,2023-08-20T15:31:16-07:00,"App crashes and corrupts my ride file every time I ride. This means I can’t post my ride to Strava. I ride a 2019 Pivot Shuttle V1. 

My last e-bike was a specialized e-bike and the app was my favorite part of the bike. It allowed me to view my power data and seamlessly post rides to Strava. If this app doesn’t improve my next e-bike will not have a Shimano motor.",1,2.0.7,ZeppelinFTW,negative

22,2022-05-07T16:20:13-07:00,"We had trouble connecting to one of our bikes, so I took off a star. If you can get it connected, it’s a very useful, solid app that’s worth having. 

The bike that has trouble actually gave us an error code while trying to connect and wouldn’t turn on. We reseated the battery to get the bike back in operational mode, but until we figured that out ourselves, the bike was an expensive brick. We have still not been successful connecting that bIke to the app. We’ll try again at some point.",4,2.0.2,path trekker,positive
23,2022-05-01T17:56:05-07:00,$6000 bike. No documentation on how any of this works. All YouTube videos show older units I believe as mine only has one place to charge. Can’t tell if sensor is on or off. Bike documentation tells me to download an app that doesn’t exist. Not really surprised though. All of this computer garbage is getting worse and worse. None of it works no matter how much you pay. This is probably the worst implementation of “technology” I have ever seen. Bravo Giant Bicycles and Shimano!!!,1,2.0.2,CG,negative
24,2022-01-08T10:33:37-07:00,Just put out a simple one that shows how much battery is left. You can update with more features later. I don’t want to bring my phone on rides.,3,2.0.1,Roxanneolson,neutral
25,2021-09-01T13:22:43-07:00,"The new update released today has a major IOS flaw. After opening the app, if you inadvertently touch and drag the screen even slightly, the app prematurely closes, not just minimized. 

Any properly written IOS app should only close if dragged from the bottom of screen and upward to the screen top. This flaw also makes it impossible to open other apps on the iPhone without risking prematurely closing the Shimano app. 

I enjoyed using the previous version of this app, but this new version is frustrating. Please fix the app asap to confirm with standard IOS swiping motions.",1,2.0.0,kbpaulson,negative
26,2021-08-10T20:30:08-07:00,"It displays a GPS map and my speed and keeps track of where I've gone and how fast I rode my bike. TopSpeed and all those good things but I have an 8000 and this does not actively communicate fully with the steps software and therefore I can't give it five stars because it lacks a lot of functionality at this point in time.

27,2021-05-31T11:04:09-07:00,"Does what it does well, but i feel its missing a few valuable technical display options: a graph, while i ride, showing how many watts i am cranking over the last minute or so; and a similar graph showing motor total output and if it was limited by watts, or torque, or speed. And in ride log, same graphs over the whole ride. It would also be nice to get my total watt minutes for a logged ride, and watt minutes accumulated so far in the ride, and so on. And NUMBERS please, not unscaled graphs and 1..100%! For bonus points, show battery remaining change in watt hours, so i can estimate my situation based on what i know is ahead in the terrain.",3,1.1.2,Kirk Reinholtz,neutral

After many attempts made a connection with the E-Tube project app, pretty ridiculous!

E tube project is extremely limited as far as adjustments for the motor goes.  It would be nice to be able to really tune the motor ramp settings.  Time for Shimano to up their game to compete for the next generation of mountain biking!  Electric is changing the game.  Also comparative to other electric assist, Shimano’s E 8000 kicks in and out of assist very harshly.  Would be nice to smooth out the transition.",1,1.0.0,ShredHead1,negative

The E-tube app does work but even that is severely lacking compared to what Specialized has going on with their Mission Control for the Levo.  Shimano needs to direct some of their limitless resources to giving these apps more functionality.",1,1.0.0,T Van 1975,negative
