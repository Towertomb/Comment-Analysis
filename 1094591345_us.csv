The performance is overall very laggy too. The movements are janky, and the ability to zoom in and out with just a tap on the screen is really the most of it. During car rides, I’ll try to tap a pokemon that shows up just for the screen to zoom in or out like crazy and I struggle to get it back to normal for a bit.

7,2025-12-11T06:22:24-07:00,I love the game its so fun and addicting to play but im displeased by the coins system for gyms. My pokemon been at 1 gym for 34 days and i only got 50 coins. It will be cool if i get it over time or even when he returns cause people are constantly fighting for gyms so its harder to obtain the coins. But the coin system for gyms need to be fixed.

Seeing my pokemon come back from surviving in the park for a whole 2 days for 50 coins is just dumb. There's also some bugs where you get a white screen when you tap on a pokemon. In pvp I had a 1 on 1 against a Charizard on the end, the game said weak connection then they pulled a dragon claw out after literally just sending out their Charizard cause they were able to farm me for energy while it said ""poor connection"" and I couldn't do anything. The pvp bugs are a must fix because they're so infuriating. Also another thing, please bring legendaries back in the research breakthroughs. Using pokemon as a money grab is insane, the remote raid pass changes killed off an active raiding community at my closest park, there are some people that can't even properly experience the game cause of their area and gutting remote raid passes into the floor just made the experience so much worse, especially with the introduction of XL candy and the consistent paywall put on the good events now. also to the idiot writing in all caps about how he can't hit ace rank genuinely a skill issue but gave me a good laugh",1,0.389.2,Ethan Sederap,negative

49,2025-12-08T11:04:02-07:00,It’s rigid. The battle match making isn’t random at all. Pokemon go is a good game in idea. But the greediness of the company kills it. Battle league is made of Great Ultra and Master. If you like Pokemon don’t power them up to max for Master league unless is Legendary. All other Pokemon are useless minus 2-3 but you’ll need to use both shields for one Mewtwo and then they have two more legendary after. Why not get legendary of your own? To get the chance you need raid passes which they give you one a day and you have to pay for the rest. Good luck getting anything good if you don’t have the funds to play. Not to mention you’ll need 4 or more to win the battle hope you don’t live in a small area cause then you HAVE to buy and be invite by a friends or a entire different 3rd party app to play. The in game currency is won through gums. 50 coins max a day no matter is you have 20 guns cause they want you to spend real more to buy the fake money to play the game. It’s not a free game unless you live in a large area and are okay with not actually playing 50% of the game. While you can’t reach out to the support team they aren’t helpful at all.

Biggest gripe is the “this Pokémon is in a gym” issue that has recently became more of a problem.  At times my family will ask me to get on and help with a fight, trade a few monsters, assist in a party quest or two.
  This is hindered when I can’t trade my Pokémon for some reason and the only clue is its at a gym… but it isn’t at a gym, its a Pokémon i got exclusively to trade.  Is it graphical? Is there another reason?  Not enough resources? Too much of a level gap? A unique Pokémon? Because its 100% not in a gym. It’s not left at a poke stop.  

If it’s a bug, acknowledge it.  If its another reason, describe it accurately.

198,2025-11-30T16:05:15-07:00,"I’ve played Pokémon Go on and off since launch, and honestly? At this point it deserves one star — and that’s generous. Nearly every major complaint the community has raised over the last few years is still unresolved or has gotten worse.

1. Remote Raids Were Gutted
The remote raid nerfs were one of the biggest blows to the game. Costs went up, limits were added, and accessibility tanked. Players who can’t travel, rural communities, and anyone with a busy schedule all got punished. It felt like Niantic forgot the entire reason those raids existed: to let people actually play.

2. The “Exploration” Philosophy Hurts More Than It Helps
Niantic keeps forcing the “get outside and walk” angle by making features inconvenient unless you’re in a major city. The problem is: not everyone lives in a downtown full of PokéStops. Rural players still get barely any spawns, few gyms, and almost no new stops approved. The “exploration” lecture gets old when the in-game world barely exists outside urban hubs.

3. Event Fatigue & Low Quality Events
Events used to be exciting. Now they’re constant, repetitive, and full of recycled spawns, bad shiny rates, and FOMO. So many “paid” events deliver almost nothing of value. You finish one underwhelming event and immediately another one starts — usually requiring more money, more passes, and more walking for the same stale rewards.

4. Bugs… Bugs Everywhere
This game still crashes, freezes during raids, fails to register throws, loses GPS for no reason, and has lag spikes during literally every important moment. For a billion-dollar franchise, the technical quality shouldn’t feel like a beta test.

5. Too Much Monetization, Too Little Improvement
The shop is overflowing with overpriced boxes and paywalled features, but basic quality-of-life updates (increased storage, better sort/filter tools, better gym mechanics) are slow or nonexistent. It feels like Niantic is always ready to charge for something but rarely ready to fix anything.

6. Communication Is Terrible
Changes get rolled out without warning, player feedback is ignored, and when the community pushes back, the response is usually vague PR language. It gives the impression that Niantic doesn’t actually play its own game.",1,0.387.1,Norig Zenun,negative

201,2025-11-30T12:39:52-07:00,"This game was once a favorite of mine and I used to enjoy playing it religiously. Unfortunately it has become increasingly unpleasant to play.

Number one example: remote raids are a ripoff with the game crashing 10-25% of the time while raiding. Remote raid passes are expensive and when the pass is loss due to the game crashing, Niantic will not compensate players. After filing claims, users will receive an automated message claiming the user was already “rewarded” for the raid when in fact users did not have an opportunity to catch the raid boss. After restarting the game, there is no mechanism to return to a remote raid in order to complete it. As a result, users lose a remote raid pass. Niantic provides zero compensation for the lost pass, which many users paid for.

It is one thing if remote raids passes are free, but when users pay for these passes and the game crashes, it “steals” people’s money without compensation. That is not right!",1,0.387.1,***DC***,negative

Please consider adding a re-enter button to the Power Spot tab for trainers who used a remote raid pass to rejoin the lobby without needing to wait for another invite. This game is wonderful and a lot of fun to play everyday. 
However with the release of Dynamax Lugia, I lost 2 Remote Raid passes due to not being able to rejoin the lobbies because I can not do so unless I’m invited. I found this to be disappointing because I saved up for the Remote pass bundle but immediately lost 2 due to not being able to rejoin. The Pokemon GO game app is still wonderful, and innovations like a button to re-enter a Remote Raid/Remote Dynamax/Remote Gigantamax lobby would improve player satisfaction. As well as help them get the most out of their items they saved up to use when new Pokemon make their debut, such as a Dynamax Lugia. I hope this message finds you well. Happy holidays and thank you for you time.

237,2025-11-28T13:40:30-07:00,"Overall, I’d like to say that this game is fantastic. However, there are a few flaws and such that don’t make it perfect. For example, sometimes the lack of things to do can lead to boredom. For new players, here is something to note; this game is not good to resort to when your stuck at home. It is an outdoor game and is best played when outside. Continue my review for more in-depth information and thoughts.

There should be some things added to Pokemon Go that would improve it. One of the things I would like the most is the addition of more things to do with your buddy Pokemon. For those who don’t know, your buddy Pokemon is a Pokemon that you choose to accompany you on your journey. Though you are able to pet, feed and take pictures with your buddy, it’s all kind of plain. Maybe instead of just petting your buddy to fill up the play hearts, you could actually play with your buddy! There could be toys to unlock, such as rubber bones, tennis balls, etc. With this addition, you could also increase that maximum play hearts from one to three. Another suggestion for the buddy Pokemon is to spruce up feeding them. You simply throw a berry of your choice at them and they eat. What if you could prepare the berries? If you prepared them well, it could make them travel longer with you! This next idea may have a couple flaws, but I also think the addition of beds and dens would be cool. Your buddy could sit in them and relax, though I don’t know if it would have much of a purpose. Moving away from buddy Pokemon, there are a few more things I would like to discuss. During COVID-19, there was a weekly box for 1 pokecoin. Though I see why the developers wouldn’t want to add it back due to such a low price, adding something similar would be great. For example, you could sell a few random rare items each week for 50 pokecoins. Though this could leave a dent in currency, it would benefit many players and more people would enjoy the game. I have one last suggestion I would like to make; camera mode. If you click on a Pokemon in the map, you can go into AR mode. But what if you could just look around with the camera and you could find hiding Pokemon? I can see this being fairly complicated, but it would be a game-changing addition and 5-star ratings would fly to the sky. 

There are multiple flaws throughout the game. But I have come up with some ideas to handle them. For one; raids. In quieter towns, you are likely to be the only person raiding, which can be a problem if your trying to take down an opponent with more than 8,000 CP. Considering that the most wanted opponents range between 40,000 - 50,000, this can be fairly hard for some people. To fix this, people in the area should get a notification that a person has joined a certain raid and that they are searching for members. It would look something like this:

“(Player) is looking for members to help defeat (Pokemon) at (Location)!”

I know that Niantic Campfire exists for this reason, but it would be easier if you could just get a notification. Another one of the flaws is actually Campfire itself. I understand that it’s easy for the developers since it supports all their games. But what about the player? Having the download another app makes no sense. Campfire should just be installed into their games. The app can also be dangerous. Announcing your location to anybody with the app is a huge issue. Imagine how many people that just downloaded the app to get someone’s location? 

But overall, if you’re thinking about getting this game, I say you should download it. It’ll give you a fun experience if you like to be active and you’ll definitely enjoy it. Just remember to safe and be aware that while this game is good it has its flaws!",5,0.387.1,Reviewer372728,positive

Niantic should focus more instead on *actual* micro transactions that encourage users to play across all aspects of the game.  So much more potential with the battle system and many other things.

Even if you do it in person. It’s the patterns you notice that make you realize that I’m right in some way about this.

You only get an automated message saying “after a thorough review” and then the message says something that doesn’t even apply. 

Even when asked what they meant by the irrelevant response, you get another identical automated message.

Absolute garbage.

470,2025-11-15T13:12:19-07:00,I love the game and everything but it’s kinda buggy and heavily relies on having service or internet connection. For example they added the routes and I tried to do one but it would not connect to my location so I had to go back to the same location to unpause the route 3 times after I had already finished it. When I’m in fights with other Pokémon it bugs out so bad that when I try to fight I honestly have no idea who is winning or not.,3,0.385.2,Brooke hamond,neutral

It was a 54k necrozoma and i was with my uncle and some friends. I was playing and we were so close to beating it but then i got kicked and couldn't rejoin. I ended up wasting over 12 max revives, a raid pass that i couldn't get back, and never got the necrozoma.

The variety of catchable Pokemon is a joke with over 1000, but it’s the same 10 showing up every day until they change the season and its a different 10 Pokemon for 3 months. Wild low CP with garbage stats are raid level difficulty to catch for no reason forcing you to throw 3+ balls so you keep buying more! There used to be variety in wild Pokemon, every day could be different. Now this game feels like a chore, get your daily bonus and get out. The game with the most potential became a blatant cash grab with no remorse.
