Do you realize how crazy that is?  Imagine having to watch an ad before you can start your car!  Or having to watch an ad before you can turn on your stove!
We have already paid for the device, and turning it on and off should not require us to line your pockets with a penny, here and there.
STOP BEING GREEDY! 
This will definitely affect my decision when I purchase my next scooter! 
And if you have yet to purchase yours, let this be a warning!

This message is blocking view!!! 2) Also: I need a button on the main screen - which will allow once a charge to 100% without changing charge limit settings. So for example, if I have a charge limit set to 80% and I press charge to max(100%) button then this time until I disconnect cable charging will be up to 100%, only this time. So I don’t need to go to setting and change charge limit to 100 and then go back.. I really need just one tap and charge to 100% right now and only once. 4.

Just wish I could see live power info on the ninebot display instead of my phone but oh well! The app runs smooth, it connects to the scooter very very fast, almost instantly when I open the app! Although it’s a good app there’s always room for improvement. Being able to customize what your scooter dash is displaying would be a huge upgrade for customers. Personally I’d love to see live battery watts or percentage up there, not just speed.

There is no way a person would know this is the correct app until after your Cube arrives. Per the instructions, you have to use the QR code from the instructions card enclosed with the product. Then sync the app using Bluetooth to find your product and complete the process. 
Now, I live in a small framed house with sufficient internet. Unless I’m in the same room with the Cube, I loose the Bluetooth connection, having me to reconnect. I too realize the app doesn’t turn on or off the device, only controls your settings after it’s powered up. I find the app less than desirable especially if you are in a no grid situation. Not much use either if you are boon-docking and away from civilization.

223,2023-02-28T13:34:03-07:00,"Perhaps too simple? Overall, the app does let me set an alarm on my scooter, unlocked the higher speed, and actually I appreciate the brief riders safety course. Sure, I know I ought to wear a helmet and protection, but it sets the vibe that Segway/Ninebot users are likely to be a little more safety conscious.

As far as the scooter itself goes, mine is a Walmart version D18W. It owes its 30 lbs weight to the smaller battery capacity… to be able to ride up the obnoxiously steep hill by my house AND keep up with car traffic (no sidewalk), I would need a drastically more powerful scooter, one which would be too heavy to practically carry up steps (or the hill if it only was able to reach 5mph faster top speed). 15mph is honestly as fast as I want to go when I occasionally have to go over cracks, and I can still make a round trip to a cafe and a grocery store before heading back home on one charge (1 mile battery to spare). I don’t feel at all like the scooter will shoot out from under me like my eSkateboard has done, and it seems to absorb bumps and cracks as well as my bike. Grey is a little boring, but I have to admit it looks sleek.

The app has some pros and cons. It’s still a 5-star review, because the app lets me do what I want to do, is easy to arm the alarm and track the scoot, enable walking mode (wish I could enable this from the scooter itself, without a phone), and the eBrake takes a little getting used to but then I need to use the drum break much less. The con is that it doesn’t seem easy to use the community features… there’s a points reward system, which is cool, but it talks about posting comments and reviews, and I don’t see how to do that from the main screen, profile, or “homepage.” So I’ll probably never earn enough reward points to mean anything 😅. Hard to use bonus features aside, the core function is good and hasn’t glitched on me.

Overall, unlike my skateboard, I finally feel like I have my first EV and a decent “last mile” solution. I wouldn’t want anything heavier, and for something faster I would rather have a seated moped scooter that can ride on the street with traffic (so, with hills, I would need a scooter that could hit 35 mph on a 25° incline to be safe among car traffic).

I have an extended bar that I can put extra add-ons like flashlights,GoPro and other devices like cell phone holder. All these you can buy on segways website or Amazon.

 The Ninebots do not go the advertised speed (20mph) and that makes them unsafe to take on the road. 20 km is as fast as they’ve gone—it’s NOT the same thing. Not being able to depend on the speed is a big deal. We would not have bought them if we did not think we could trust them to go as advertised.
 The app does not stay connected to the scooter, and we’ve had issues with locking it and not being able to unlock it.  We hoped to use it as alternative transportation to firing up our truck for small errands; now we have to take the truck to pick up the scooter/s.
 From what other reviewers have said, the speed could be fixed via the app. As for the lock issue,  If you’re going to sell a high end scooter, it would be smart to build a sufficient app to go with it.

481,2020-08-14T16:16:39-07:00,"So few things work well in this app. It’s a huge letdown, considering the price of the scooters it interfaces with. 

1. Trip tracking rarely works at all, so don’t even *think* about keeping track of keeping track of how far your scooter has gone. As an odometer it’s a colossal fail.

2. The ‘remaining range’ is wildly optimistic. Even at reduced speed on a very flat course with very few stops, I’ve never gotten more than 18 miles on a charge. (15 is more like it.) But maybe I just got a bad scooter.  

3. I didn’t buy a scooter so I could take ‘scooter selfies’ or turn myself into a scooter-media influencer. I bought it to get around, and the whole ‘community’ side of the app does nothing that I need. 

A working odometer and a realistic ‘range remaining’ are all I need. But this app falls far short.",2,V5.1.3,Even more lucidity,negative
