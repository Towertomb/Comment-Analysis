After the April update most functions worked except ride distance was always 0.0 miles. Several updates later and that’s still not fixed.

Forget even trying to contact the manufacturer for help. Crickets. This is just like when I emailed them a few weeks ago and asked for a manual for my bike that actually pertained to it, and they provided me with a link to the manual that I just complained about. 

It’s like a cross between Monty Python and Seinfeld, but without the humor. Hey - let’s have someone spend four figures - a lot of money - for a bike - and then provide them with a manual that literally has nothing to do with the bike you just purchased.

You can map your rides on your phone, and upload it to Strava, but why not just use Strava? I tried it, don’t hate it, but iit gives me what I already had. My advice is, don’t use it unless you need to. If your bike is running just fine, don’t mess with it.  I’d like to see an app that gives a useful automatic assist, like a cruise control instead of a battery eater. I’d like to set up a PIN on the control unit. I’d like an app that really helps me get the most out of my bike. I don’t want an app that updates all the time with no visible difference.

43,2024-05-31T04:43:22-07:00,"I’ve had a few problems with the app. My biggest is forgetting to log in while I have cell service and before I arrive at my trailhead because I usually don’t have cell service where I ride. Otherwise, it won’t open, I can’t see my battery status, speed, etc. It’s a big issue. I hate it but it’s all we’ve got. I’m trying to learn to live with it—by trying to remember to log in while I have cell service and not before I lose it, which can be tricky. 

However, since the big update, every time the app resets to metric. My profile still says Imperial but my bike control shows me kilometers to empty or kilometers per hour, which doesn’t help me to monitor my speed on public roads. It’s become an issue that when we pause our bike for too long and try to reconnect (like stopping to eat), it again resets my app to metric. My profile still shows Imperial but I can’t get to that while on a ride without closing the ride. In fact, in order to get it to reconnect, I have to close the app and pray it recognizes that I want to continue my ride when I reopen it, which has become the only way to reconnect. However, when I am able to reconnect, it reverts back to metric until I save my ride, go into settings, and then when I back out of settings, everything goes back to Imperial. Until I close and reopen my app again….

Prior to the big change a couple months ago, I loved everything about the app except that I need to log in while I have cell service or I can’t track my ride. The reconnect was a little funny because the “reconnect” would stay lit the rest of the ride even though we’d reconnected. That’s no longer an issue because the reconnect icon isn’t working for me anymore.",3,1.25.2,Roinva,neutral

I’m miles away and want to know the charge in my main and booster batteries and I can’t. Who designed this app? I suspect someone who’s never ridden a Mtb. Additionally, this incompetently designed app does not support readings of the second Plus battery. While away from the internet you are left with five leds to tell you battery strength. It’s amazing that an app for $5000 to $12000 bikes has an app developed that is such a miss, and has been the center of complaints for four years. Giant obviously couldn’t care less.

And have a look at the BOT generated response that Giant has below this review. Same for everyone. There is never a real response since they do not care!",1,1.12.0,freddymm,negative

I am on the top of the mountain and want to check the exact charge of the battery to make sure I can reach home. After using it for two months without the need to log in, suddenly, the app asks for my email address and password. There is no cell phone coverage. The controller does not have an LCD display, so I have to use this app. My password does not work. The app is useless if you cannot log in. Why do I need to log into the app if anyone can connect to my bike standing in the vicinity using the Giant app with their account. The security should be on the bike, not on the app. It is not fair to restrict MY access to MY bike, just because you are collecting email addresses.",1,1.7.2,Laszlo75023,negative

84,2021-06-13T10:13:37-07:00,The latest “update” sent my very expensive e-bike back to the Stone Age. I connected the app to the bike as I’d done previously many times and it asked for me to update the bike in order to connect. A few minutes later and a few blinking lights on my bikes controller and it was dead. Update failed is what the app told me. The bike shows no sign of life. It currently sits at the bike shop while they negotiate with Giant. Thousands upon thousands of dollars sitting in the shop being completely useless because of an “update”.

I have tried all the suggestions in the support section in the app. It keeps saying “Update failed, unknown mcu version” and disconnects the app. I even tried to install it through the Bluetooth on my iPhone, and does not show up as a device. The bike works great. It would be nice if the app did also.

93,2020-12-14T12:19:10-07:00,"I thought that I would be able to use this app as a bike computer. However the basic numbers (eg speed) are displayed in a small font and not in a high contrast color scheme. You can switch to a screen without the map but the vital stats display in an even tinier font on this screen. 

Then there is no way to turn off GPS and use the stats (eg speed) from the bike. So you have the option of using the app and using battery sucking gps or not using the app. 

I was able to update the firmware on my bike and not brick it so thankful for  that and I can check bike status and change the sync drive levels. 

In my opinion useless as a ride computer or ride tracker based on the above two issues.",1,1.2.1,apri84,negative
